# Blender for Spotify

**Blender for Spotify** is a Django-based tool for generating custom Spotify playlists, using the Spotify API.
Users can input up to 5 **seeds** in the form of artists, tracks and genres, which are then used to create a similar playlist.
Further customisation can be added by the user by specifying playlist length and name
